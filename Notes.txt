Ranges for values:

Note: Some maybe should exagerate for fun? Not all though, like gamma

Thrust 0 - 20,000,000 N (highest 16,000,000 N)

Isp 0 - 600 s chemical reockets (highest 542 s) (up to 15,000 for experimental electrical thrusters)

m_dot 0 15,000 kg/s (12,890 kg/s for 5 F1 engines, so maybe only use 1 of 5)

Cf 0-3 (most seem to be 2)

C* 0 - 4000 (seems to be around 2500 max v_exit = Cf*C_star)

Area Ratio 150:1 (max 100:1)

gamma 1-1.8

Speed of Sound 300 - 400 m/s

Exit Area 0.1 - 10 m (F1 engine 3.7 m)

Throat Area 0.1-10 m (write function to make sure)

Atm Pressure 0-1 bar (at sea level)

Chamber Pressure 0-400 bar (highest 330 bar) 

Chamber Temperature 225-4000 K (usually around 3500 K)


Missing Paramater Couplings and Inaccuaricies: 

Propellants with gamma and with density

Propellants with Temperature

No seperated flow calculations



To do notes:





-Limit number of digits in text filds on html side 
-look at decimals var function problem (educational)



-change AeAt to while loop

-change checksamebox function name
